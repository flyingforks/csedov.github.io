I am trying to figure out what to do with all this blogging stuff. I have two blogs and one medium account. Neither of my blogs are thriving, but my medium is more or less alive. I was thinking of making this platform a safe place for random thoughts and ideas about everyday stuff, and leave the other one for writing about more exciting issues, while Medium would be a place for selective writing, perhaps from both my blogs. That's stupid, right?

Anyway, I hate the fact that I cannot use one name that would be so habitual for me - Flying Forks. This domain name is taken and I can't think of a better blog name for such randomness as my writing.
