This post marks the start of my journey with Jekyll and Github. I have edited it with some more texts. Would probably use this post as a guinea pig from now on.

Another test proved to be very useful. I can open this post in **Byword** via **Working Copy**

This text, on the other hand, is written in JotterPad on an Android phone, with PocketGit acting as an interface with GitHub. How to choose?
