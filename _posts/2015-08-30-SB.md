Here I am, lying on hot sands of California, writing instead of observing the ever unrestful waters or diving under the ruthless waves of the Pacific ocean. Three years ago I would do anything for a day or two on the seaside. Sticky summers and overly chilly winters of Europe are so tiring. But today for the first time in this summer I finally felt refreshingly cool touch of water on my arms and shoulders and slick seaweed crawling around my feet. It's August, 30th.

Still, the salty air, the softness of the fine sand grains and the sound of the crashing waves are mesmerizing. How long can I wait for the next getaway like this one?

Santa Barbara is so many things. My husband and I go there for a short rustic escape from LA heat since we know the weather there is predictably lower. Yet today it was sizzling just until the moment my absolute trust was gained; a sudden gust of wind and clouds from the West shooed us back home.
