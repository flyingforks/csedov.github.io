Well, I’ve been sticking to gluten-soy-dairy-corn free diet for about a month now. I thought the hardest part would be avoiding wheat and rye, since these are the foundation of every type of food I love so much: pizza, Italian pasta, sandwiches and hamburgers, not to mention pancakes and desserts. Now that I read this list it's looks as if I used to follow a strict junk-food diet. But even sandwiches and hamburgers can be state-of-the-art cuisine, if you know how to combine ingridients. It's not that I'm a Michelin star chef to claim that I know how to tickle your taste buds, but I'm definitely good at adhering to instructions most of the time and making my own adjustments part of the time. 

Anyway, it turned out the hardest part is to avoid soy and corn -- they are everywhere, especially corn. Not explicitly, but under the cover of very technical and fancy words, such as maltodextrin (unless, of course, the manufacturer specifies that it’s tapioca maltodextrin, for instance). Soy is also very common in products you would least expect. I finally found a perfect chocolate brand that doesn’t use soy lecithin as an emulsifier and still makes pretty good dark chocolate bars. Most of soy free chocolates taste cheap, in my opinion, as if the manufacturer added cocoa powder to sugar and pressed it into a bar. Too sweet, not piquant enough. I  guess this diet boosted my desire to buy whole foods and cook at home. Most dietians now agree that you should avoid the central sections of you grocery store, i.e. the aisles with processed foods. Eating out, however, is a torture. It’s either asking a lot of questions and looking like those guys from *Portlandia* in the episode about the farm, or ordering same dish time and time again. I don’t mind doing the latter, but discovering new places became a pointless affair. 

But that’s enough of the background for now. What I really wanted to share is a recipe for amazing lemon cookies I found on the Internet. There are so many gluten free (and other stuff free) recipes I’ve found recently, that I just need some place to keep them all. I also thought of adding these recipes to [eda](http://www.eda.ru), but they are not mine, so I don’t know if it’s fair to do that. What’s about the lemon desserts, by the way? I used to hate the taste of lemon in my food. I guess it’s all because I added lemon zest in my pancakes once and that was amazing. Now lemon cookies and lemon bars are my obsession. What’s important is the amount of spices and additives in your food, I guess, unless a particular additive becomes the key ingridient. 

Back to lemon cookies. This recipre is taken from [mybakingaddiction](http://www.mybakingaddiction.com) and is called [Gluten-Free Lemon Thumbprint Cookies](http://www.mybakingaddiction.com/gluten-free-lemon-thumbprint-cookies/). I changed the ingredient list a little as well as adjusted the proportions the first time, because I did't need that many cookies. But here's the *almost* full list of ingredients"


* 2 cups blanched almond flour
* 1/4 cup coconut flour
* 1/2 cup sugar
* Pinch of salt
* 1/2 cup of cashew butter as a substitute for unsalted butter
* 1 egg
* 1 tablespoon lemon zest (from 1 lemon)
* Juice of 1 lemon (this can be varied, I think I used 2 lemons once and it was OK for me. Also, I squeezed them manually)
* 1/3 cup lemon curd (optional in my case).


1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and line a sheet with parchment paper.
2. Stir together 1 beaten egg, cashew butter, lemon juice, lemon zest.
3. Add sugar, salt, almond flour and coconut flour.
4. Stir the mixture until combined, then let it sit for 10 minutes. The coconut flour will absorb the liquid, while the oven still preheats.
5. After 10 minutes pass, roll the dough into small balls and press them a little so as to form cookies. Place them on parchment paper.
6. Bake the cookies for 6 minutes and remove the cookie sheet (if you want to bake with lemon curd)

*Next step is optional. I did it just once because making lemon curd also requires some time and I may be too lazy for that. Yet it’s delicious with the curd in the center of the cookies, so I will probably be more organized next time when I decide to bake.* 
7. Using the rounded part of the measuring spoon (or your fingers, why not), make an indentation down into each cookie. Fill each indentation with lemon curd, but do not overfill.
8. Return the cookie sheet to the oven and bake for another 5-7 minutes or until the cookies feel like they have a firm outer layer. 
9. Let the cookies cool for 5 minutes. They will also become more firm by that time.
10. Dust with powdered sugar, if desired. Keep in refrigerator in an air-tight container for up to 4 days. 

I used half of the dough to make lemon & chocolate chip cookies for my husband.
I just grated some chocolate from a chocolate bar I had and added it to 1/2 of the dough. He probably liked the result, but I can’t say for sure that lemon and chocolate are a good pair. What if I replace lemon  and lemon zest with orange and orange zest, though? I should try it!

For [Honey Sweetened Lemon Curd](http://www.texanerin.com/2014/01/honey-sweetened-lemon-curd.html) I reduced the amount of ingredients for my needs):

* 1 large egg
* 1 tablespoon of raw honey
* Zest of one lemon
* 1/4 cup of refined coconut oil or regular butter (I don’t remember what I used instead of butter and coconut oil, probably cashew butter again?)
*Juice of one lemon

I did the easy version of lemon curd, just mixing everything and cooking it immediately:

1. Mix everything in a non-stick pot (no aluminum, iron or copper; only ceramic, non-stick or stainless steel) using non-reactive utensils.
2. Heat over medium-low heat and stir constantly, until thickens -- about 5-10 minutes. 
5. Place a strainer over the container and strain lemon curd. Let it cool.
6. Store in an air-tight container in the fridge up to one week.

And that'it. As usual in my case, the preparation is messy and takes more time, than the cooking itself, but that's me. The baking itslef is easy and quick. Actually, I think I'm in the mood for some cookies right now.
