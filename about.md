Hello, world!

This is my sanctuary. Sometimes I want to say silly things or very controversial things or just random things, but am too polite or introverted to say it aloud. So let's pretend that the freedom of thought and speech actually works and listen to our opinions with respect and without preaching and going too crazy, OK?

OK, that was probably too much for starters â€“ I am not going to question the basics of socially accepted conventions or anything of the kind. But you are warned!

What you might find interesting about me is that I'm a wannabe scientist, a transhumanism enthusiast and an aspiring blogger (I  keep some good judgment to avoid the word "writer" here). So let's celebrate the joy of the mighty Internet in sharing our thoughts on some cool stuff!
